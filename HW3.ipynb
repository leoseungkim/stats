    "In a study of a behavioral self-control intervention for problem drinkers, one of the less sensitive dependent variables was number of drinking days per week (Hester & Delaney, 1997). Forty participants were assigned randomly to either receive the intervention immediately or be in a waiting list control group (i.e., n=20 per group). At the initial follow-up assessment, the means and standard deviations on Drinking Days per Week were as follows:\n",
